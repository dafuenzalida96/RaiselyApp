                <div class="answer">
                  <p>üí° Gitlab: <br> It has built in CI/CD which saves a lot of time for development and QA teams. 
                    It's also cool because it's built in a way where Github users could easily migrate and know how 
                    to use without much of a learning curve. </p>
